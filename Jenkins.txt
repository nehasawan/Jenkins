train with Shubham:

developer wrote project -> upload on git hub 
to build we use docker -> deploy on ec 2 or k8s cluste -> we monitor using Prometheus ->
if again modify code should go through all phase so it should be continuous.

all can this happen automatic  by using Jenkins - continuous integration 

CD
- continuous delivery/deployment: will automate delivery of anthing like app.
-A continuous delivery (CD) pipeline is an automated expression of your process for getting software from version control right through to your users

sojenkins use to CI.CD

Jenkins Pipeline (or simply "Pipeline" with a capital "P") is a suite of plugins which supports implementing and integrating continuous delivery pipelines into Jenkins.

Pipeline provides an extensible set of tools for modeling simple-to-complex delivery pipelines "as code"

Blue ocean:
the CD tool for teams 
 a new user experience for Jenkins based on a personalizable, modern design that allows users to graphically create, visualize and diagnose Continuous Delivery (CD) Pipelines ""
manages and controls several stages of the software delivery process, including build, documentation, automated testing, packaging, and static code analysis

 two types of Jenkins?
:Declarative and Scripted.

What are Jenkins stages?
: “Build”, “Test”, and “Deploy”.
